# Student Dropout Prediction using CRISP-DM
This project applies the CRISP-DM methodology to predict student dropout
using the UCI Student Dropout dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is based on the UCI Student Dropout dataset, 
but has been modified by the course lecturer for this project. 
Original dataset: [UCI Student Dropout Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dro)

The dataset includes student academic records and relevant features to predict both dropout and success.
